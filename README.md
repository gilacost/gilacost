## Hi 👋, my name is Josep Lluis Giralt D'Lacoste but you can call me Pep 😄

- 👼 Hashicorp products advocate
- 🐳 Docker lover
- 🚢 Kubernetes enthusiast
- 💜 Elixir writer and erlang priest ❤️
- 🏗️ Terraformer
- 🤖 A bit obsessed with automation

On a mission to change the way that teams operate and deliver software as co-founder of [BEAMOps software consultancy](https://beamops.co.uk).

## About

I am a software engineer passionate about technology in general. I like every
stage of the delivery process and I've been struggling to explain to the
market what is it what I like. I like code! It does not matter if it
implements some business logic in the application layer or if it declares some
resources at the operations layer. If you want to know more about my interests
please take a 👀 at my ventures.
