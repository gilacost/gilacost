## :partying_face: What?

Last Friday I was trying to renew my github profile and I thought that would be
nice to share something outside "coding stuff", so whoever visits it might get
to know a little bit more about myself.

Three months ago I decided to fight some anxiety episodes by running away from
them (literally), so I thought that would be cool to share my strava stats.

## :pinched_fingers: Objective

**Share a summary of the strava stats in my github profile**

## :exploding_head: Iterations

1. Iframe not rendered in github
2. Iframe not working properly anyway (add picture)
3. Floki, req and the DOM first load

### Iframe not rendered in github

## :cowboy_hat_face: Final solution

1. Elixir script to the rescue ( when was this added and link to the docs )
   1.1 Refreshing oauth token
   1.2 Getting the activities
   1.3 EEX and rewriting the readme
2. Automating the summary with GHA.
